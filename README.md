# Caissa

A sample chess application made with react. Currently only supports local play using one device for both players. Still in development and this is the current state of the same.

You know chess? Great! Same rules. Click on starting square and then click on ending square. If move is legal it will be made on the board and turn passes. Castling, en passant and promotion are all implemented, nothing missing here.
